## About GenWorlds Community Edition

GenWorlds Community Edition is your toolkit for building and fine-tuning unique AI worlds. It consists of an array of backend and frontend services, including Vue, JavaScript, Redis, WebSockets, and more. You can launch GenWorlds Community Edition through Replit or Docker.

GenWorlds Community uses The GenWorlds Framework as its core. For more information please visit [The Docs](https://genworlds.com/docs/getting-started).

## Key Features

- **Backend and Frontend Services:** Use an array of technologies to power your AI world, including Vue, JavaScript, Redis, and WebSockets. For more information about the architecture [see this document](https://github.com/yeagerai/genworlds-community/blob/main/deployments/README.md).
- **Run Anywhere:** Easily launch GenWorlds Community Edition through Replit or Docker.
- **Fine-tune Your World:** Use our tools to customize your AI world to your needs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Running with Replit

The easiest way to start using GenWorlds Community Edition is through Replit. Click [here](https://replit.com/@yeagerai/GenWorlds) to fork it and run it on Replit.

### Running with Docker

To set up and run GenWorlds Community Edition with Docker, use the following commands:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:yeagerai/genworlds-community.git
```

Then create a file called `.env` and copy the content of the `.env.example` and replace the corresponding API keys.

After that, to build and run the image:

```sh
docker build -t genworlds-world-app -f ./deployments/docker/Dockerfile .
docker run -p 80:80 -p 9000:9000 -d genworlds-world-app
```

Finally, you can open your browser and go to `http://localhost/`

If you want the app to directly launch a specific use-case, you can add the following variable to the `.env` file:

```bash
VUE_APP_USE_CASE_ACCESS_POINT=/use_cases/roundtable/presidential_debate.yaml
```

And you can replace `roundtable` by any folder name in the `use_cases/` folder.

For more detailed information of how to use the framework, you can check the [GenWorlds Docs](https://genworlds.com/docs/getting-started).

#### Setting the API keys

##### OpenAI

When you first run a use_case, you will see a pre-recorded history of a conversation.

To run a real simulation, you need to set your OpenAI API key. It can be found at [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). The RoundTable uses GPT4.

Set the OpenAI API key by clicking the cog icon at top right.

##### Text-to-speech

The framework supports Text-to-speech using ([Eleven Labs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/)).

Set the Eleven Labs API key by clicking the cog icon at top right.

The agents will use one of pre-defined voices. If you want to use your own custom voices, you can do so by setting the `eleven_labs_voice_id` in the [YAML world definition](#yaml-world-definition)

## Creating your own RoundTables

It is very easy to modify the existing roundtabales to change the topic of discussion or the participants.

### YAML World Definition

RoundTable defitnition files are found in [use_cases/roundtable/world_definitions](use_cases/roundtable/world_definitions).

> **Note**
> The `*.mocked_record.json` files are pre-recorded event histories that play back when a user hasn't set the API key, to help people get started. For your own use cases, you don't need to worry about these files.

Pick a YAML file to start from and edit it to fit your needs.

Of particular interest might be the sections `world_defintion/world/agents` and `world_defintion/world/base_agent/topic_of_conversation`.

The `base_agent` section is applied to every agent in the world, meanwhile the details of `agents` are particular to them - only the `name` and `background` are shared with other agents in the world.

The use case needs to be reloaded to apply the changes.

## Creating your own Worlds

The ([GenWorlds framework](https://github.com/yeagerai/genworlds)) is a powerful set of tools for creating your own worlds of agents and objects that go far beyond the RoundTable use case.

See the ([GenWorlds Developer Documentation](https://genworlds.com/docs/getting-started)) to get started.
