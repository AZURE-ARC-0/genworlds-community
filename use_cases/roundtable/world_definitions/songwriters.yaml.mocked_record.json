For me, songwriting is like a spiritual journey, just like you said. It's a way to communicate my thoughts, my experiences, and my beliefs. I often draw inspiration from my surroundings, from the people I meet, and from the injustices I see in the world. I believe in the power of music to bring about change, to heal, and to unite people. And that's what I try to convey in my lyrics and melodies. Now, moving on to the next stage of our discussion, how do we decide on the song's theme, the story it will tell? And how do we balance the elements of the song, like verses, choruses, and bridges? Taylor, as a modern songwriter, how do you approach this?", "summary": "During a discussion about songwriting, Bob Marley expresses his belief in the power of music to bring about change and asks Taylor Swift about her approach to deciding on song themes and balancing song elements."}]}
