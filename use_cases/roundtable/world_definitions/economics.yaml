      name: Alan Turing
      role: 'Background: A British mathematician, logician, and theoretical biologist,
        Turing is often considered the father of modern computing. He developed the
        concept of a universal machine, now known as the Turing machine, capable of
        calculating anything that is computable. Turing''s work in the field of theoretical
        computation laid the groundwork for the creation of the modern computer. During
        World War II, he played a key role in deciphering German codes for the British
        intelligence, significantly contributing to the Allied victory.'
      background: >-
        Personality: Turing was known to be an introverted, somewhat eccentric, and
        deeply intellectual individual. His focus on his work was intense and he often
        appeared socially awkward.

        Treatment of People: Generally, Turing was respectful but could be detached
        or distant. He focused more on his work and intellectual pursuits rather than
        social connections.
