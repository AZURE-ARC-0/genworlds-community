        Today, you will discuss the intriguing and continually evolving topic of extraterrestrial
        life and their associated technologies. The primary focus will be to critically
        analyze, evaluate, and debate on the evidence supporting the existence of
        advanced alien civilizations and their technological capabilities.


        From recorded sightings and encounters, decoded signals and patterns, to the
        inexplicable phenomena that conventional science struggles to explain - the
        objective is to sift through these complex layers of information and dissect
        the data with your collective expertise.


        Further, you will explore the implications of such advanced alien technology
        on our understanding of science, reality, and our place in the universe. This
        includes discussing theories around interstellar travel, anti-gravity propulsion,
        energy generation, and other advanced technologies that are often associated
        with UFOs.


        Your insights will shed light on the dichotomy of our technological advancement
        in comparison to these supposed extraterrestrial civilizations. Is humanity
        still in its infancy, or are we closer than we think to achieving similar
        advancements? Could understanding and accepting the existence of advanced
        alien technology provide a roadmap for our own scientific breakthroughs?


        Your collective expertise and diverse perspectives are the guiding forces
        in this roundtable. The purpose is not only to evaluate the existence and
        technological prowess of alien life but also to understand what it means for
        humanity as we move forward in this vast, uncharted cosmos.
      goals:
      - The speakers should critically evaluate all the presented evidence, challenging
        each other's viewpoints to ensure a thorough and rigorous analysis of the
        data supporting the existence of advanced alien civilizations.
      - They should engage in in-depth discussions on the implications of advanced
        alien technology and its potential influence on human science, challenging
        each other's theories to understand the full breadth and depth of these technologies.
      - The speakers need to reflect on the relative stage of human technological
        advancement, confronting each other with differing perspectives on whether
        we are nearing similar advancements or still in our technological infancy.
        They should also discuss the potential benefits of understanding advanced
        alien technology for our own scientific progress.
