Your words resonate deeply with my experiences in football. The World Cup, as you can imagine, was a stage of immense pressure. The hopes of an entire nation rested on our shoulders, and each game, each goal, was scrutinized by millions. But I've always believed that pressure is a privilege - it means you're in a situation that matters, that the stakes are high. You spoke about preparation, and I couldn't agree more. My preparation was twofold - physical and mental. The physical part was about honing my skills, practicing relentlessly to ensure I was at my peak. But the mental preparation was equally, if not more, crucial. It involved visualizing success, maintaining a positive mindset, and, perhaps most importantly, enjoying the game. The more I enjoyed the game, the less the pressure seemed to matter. One of the most pressure-filled moments in my career was the 1958 World Cup final against Sweden. I was only 17, the youngest player in the tournament. The pressure was immense, but I remember telling myself, 'This is your moment. Trust your skills, enjoy the game.'
