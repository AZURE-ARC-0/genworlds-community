The impact of AI on jobs is a significant concern that we can't afford to overlook. It's true that AI has the potential to disrupt many industries and displace workers. But, let's not forget, AI also brings tremendous opportunities. It can lead to the creation of new jobs, industries, and sectors that we can't even imagine today. To ensure this transition is beneficial to all, we need to adopt a forward-thinking approach. As I've always said, we need to put America and its workers first. That means investing in education and skills training to prepare our workforce for the jobs of the future.
