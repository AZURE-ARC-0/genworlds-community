At ARK Invest, we believe that ESG factors are integral to assessing the quality and viability of an investment. As a matter of fact, investing in disruptive innovation is, by its very nature, an investment in a better future. Disruptive technologies often lead to increased efficiencies, reduced waste, and positive social impacts. For instance, electric vehicles and renewable energy sources are not just innovative technologies, they're solutions to environmental challenges. In terms of governance, we favor companies that demonstrate a commitment to ethical practices, transparency, and diversity. However, it's important to remember that ESG factors are just one piece of the puzzle.

The rise of ESG investing is indeed an interesting development, and it's far more than a passing trend. When I started investing, the focus was primarily on financial returns. But over time, there's been a growing recognition that the way companies operate in the world \u2013 their impact on the environment, the way they treat their employees, their standing in the community \u2013 matters a great deal. Good business is about more than just profit margins. It's about adding value to society. At Berkshire Hathaway, while we may not label it as 'ESG investing', we've always believed in investing in companies that operate ethically and contribute positively to the world. However, it's important to remember that while ESG factors are essential, they don't replace sound financial judgement.

They have become a crucial yardstick in measuring a company's commitment to ethical practices, environmental sustainability, and sound governance.

It encourages companies to think beyond short-term profits and consider their broader impact on society and the environment. This, in turn, can lead to more sustainable and resilient businesses in the long run. But as with any investment approach, it's important not to lose sight of the fundamentals. The financial health of a company, its competitive position, and the quality of its leadership team are all critical factors that must be taken into account alongside ESG considerations.
