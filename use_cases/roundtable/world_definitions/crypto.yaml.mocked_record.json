In terms of regulation, it's important to note that it isn't a magic bullet, but a tool that can provide a framework for accountability and trust in the crypto market. I believe the key aspect of this should be a global, standard-set approach rather than a fragmented, country-by-country one. This would help ensure that rules are consistently applied, reducing the chance of malfeasance slipping through the cracks. Moreover, it's crucial that regulatory bodies work in tandem with the industry to understand the unique complexities of the crypto market. This includes the tech behind it, the pace at which it evolves, and the global nature of transactions. Only then can they formulate regulations that are effective and not stifling innovation.

What you've outlined is certainly a delicate balance to achieve. The integrity of the crypto space depends on strong, cooperative regulation that respects the pace of innovation.
