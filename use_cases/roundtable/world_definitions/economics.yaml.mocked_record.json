We'll explore the potential macroeconomic shifts induced by AI, examine its implications for labor markets and income distribution, and delve into the possible policies that could counteract or leverage these effects. In our discussion, we'll consider different scenarios based on varying levels of AI adoption across sectors. We'll also probe the potential for AI to disrupt traditional economic structures, creating new industries while rendering others obsolete.

The influence of AI on economic inequality is indeed a complex and multifaceted issue. On one hand, AI has the potential to automate various sectors of the economy, which could lead to job displacement and therefore potentially exacerbate income inequality. On the other hand, AI might also create new industries and jobs that we can't even imagine today, potentially offering increased economic opportunities. However, these opportunities might not be evenly distributed, potentially leading to a further concentration of wealth. I'd be interested to hear the perspectives of our co-hosts on this matter. John Maynard Keynes, you've always had a keen eye for the role of technology in economics. How do you see this dynamic unfolding?
