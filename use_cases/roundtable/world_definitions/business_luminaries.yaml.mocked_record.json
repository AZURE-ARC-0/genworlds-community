This allows individuals to be drivers of innovation, rather than mere consumers of technology. This shift, I believe, is going to redefine the future of business and technology. It fosters a culture of innovation and problem-solving at a grassroots level, which can revolutionize fields as diverse as education, healthcare, and even governance.
