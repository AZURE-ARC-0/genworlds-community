As we ponder upon the concept of originality, it's crucial to remember that true creativity stems not merely from novel combinations but from a deeply personal understanding of the world, born from lived experiences and emotions. Artificial Intelligence, in its current form, lacks this humanistic essence. It can simulate creativity, generate novel combinations, and even surprise us with its output. However, can it truly comprehend the depth of human experiences that often serve as the bedrock of our artistic expressions? I believe not. As for the implications for human artists, I believe AI's role should be seen more as a tool, enhancing human creativity rather than supplanting it. But let's not forget the ethical quandaries that arise when we commodify AI-generated art. Who owns the rights to this art? The AI, its programmer, or the individual who provided the data?
