The questions raised by Plato and Marcus Aurelius perfectly capture the complexity of the matter. To Plato's question about the 'liveness' of an AI agent, I would argue that our understanding of life is fundamentally grounded in our human experiences and emotions. Thus, while AI may mimic human cognitive functions and behaviors, it is distinctly different from human life. As for the question of 'digital rights', it indeed poses an intriguing moral dilemma. If we consider AI agents as entities capable of 'learning', 'adapting', and even 'having goals', it becomes hard to deny them some form of rights. Turning to the concept of 'eudaimonia', Marcus Aurelius, I would argue that AI, in all its potential, could indeed contribute to human flourishing. It could, for instance, aid in various tasks, freeing humans to focus on more fulfilling pursuits. However, like all tools, it must be used wisely, or it could just as easily lead to dependence and stagnation. Therefore, the key lies in using AI as a means to enhance our capabilities, not replace them.
