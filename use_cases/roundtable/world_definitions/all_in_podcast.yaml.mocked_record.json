And who knows, maybe by then, GenWorlds would have made some progress and swayed some of us skeptics. Until then, let's get back to work, shall we?", "summary": "The speaker discusses the potential risks and benefits of GenWorlds, an AI-powered open-source framework, and suggests further consideration before investing."}]}
