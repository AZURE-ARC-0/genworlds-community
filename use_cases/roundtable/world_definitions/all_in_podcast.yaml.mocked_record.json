Sure, GenWorlds sounds exciting, but let's not forget that the tech graveyard is filled with 'next big things'. And let's be honest, the idea of AI 'interns' running around with their own 'personalities' and 'goals' is a little unsettling. Besides, I'm not convinced that adding complexity is the answer here. Yes, AI has the potential to revolutionize industries, but it's not a magic wand. It's a tool that needs to be used intelligently and responsibly. So, rather than getting lost in the hype, we need to ask critical questions about the practicality and ethics of such a system. And most importantly, we need to make sure that it's not just a solution looking for a problem. Now, Jason, I think you were onto something with your skepticism.
