We see potential, but there are so many unanswered questions that it's like walking into a dark room. The AI space is already a competitive battleground and to succeed, you need to have a clear vision, a solid business plan, and an ironclad ethical framework. Without those, you're just another startup with a good idea. I've been in this game for a long time, and I've seen businesses come and go. Success isn't just about having a great product, it's about execution, it's about being able to handle the curveballs that come your way. So, tell us, how are you planning to overcome these challenges? And remember, money doesn't solve problems, it just creates more. You can't just throw money at these issues and hope they go away.

Here's my take. You've got a fascinating product. The idea of customizable AI environments is intriguing, and I can see the potential. But here's the thing - potential and a dollar will get you a cup of coffee. What I need to see is a solid business model. How are you going to monetize this platform? Who exactly are your target customers? And don't give me a broad answer like 'everyone who uses AI'. I want specifics. I want to know exactly how you're going to get your first thousand customers. And once you have those customers, how are you going to keep them? What's your customer retention strategy? And let's not forget the competition. There are plenty of AI platforms out there. What makes yours stand out? Why should customers choose GenWorlds over the competition? These are the questions you need to answer to convince me to invest. And remember, as an investor, I'm not just giving you money. I'm giving you my time, my expertise, and my network.
