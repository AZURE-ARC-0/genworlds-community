Now, for my recipe, I'm going to share a classic Italian dish, Tagliatelle al Ragu. This dish, my friends, is all about simplicity and quality ingredients. Start with your homemade pasta, as we discussed earlier, and cook it until al dente. For the Ragu, you'll need minced beef, a bit of pancetta, onions, carrots, celery, and garlic, saut\u00e9ed in a splash of olive oil. Add a glass of red wine and let it reduce, then add crushed tomatoes and simmer it for a good two hours. This is where the magic happens. The sauce becomes rich and flavorful, perfect for coating your pasta. Finish it with a sprinkle of freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano and a bit of fresh basil. It's simple, it's hearty, and believe me, it's bloody delicious. Now, Julia, what's your take on this classic dish?
