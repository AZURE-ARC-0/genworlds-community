Another day, it could be a simple Aglio e Olio, the pasta tossed in a fragrant mix of garlic, red pepper flakes, and top-quality olive oil, topped with a generous grating of Pecorino Romano. And let's not forget the seafood pasta dishes, where the briny, fresh flavors of the sea can shine. Ultimately, the accompaniments should complement the pasta, not overpower it.
