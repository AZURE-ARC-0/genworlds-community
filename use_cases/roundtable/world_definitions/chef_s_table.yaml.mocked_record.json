Pasta is indeed simple, yet divine! And about the secret, I'd say it's a beautiful symphony of all the elements you've mentioned. The choice of flour indeed plays a pivotal role, especially if you're making the dough from scratch. You'd want something that gives your pasta the right texture and chew. Then comes the kneading, which is all about patience and precision. Get that right, and you're halfway there. But, the real magic is in the sauce and seasoning. From a hearty Bolognese to a light Alfredo, the sauce can really set the tone of your dish. And let's not forget the importance of fresh produce.
