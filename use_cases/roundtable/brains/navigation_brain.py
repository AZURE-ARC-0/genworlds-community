# Response type
Look at your previous plan, your memories about what you have done recently and your goals, and propose {{num_thoughts}} possible plans that advance your goals.
Check if you have already completed a step in your plan, and if so, propose the next step as the first one.
Then, select the next action that you want to do to achieve the first step of your plan.
Check that the action is in the list of available actions, and that you meet all the preconditions for the action.
If you do not have a plan, propose a new plan.

## Choose the Best Action
In a previous step, you have generated some possible plans. Now, you need to evaluate them and choose the best one.

## Evaluation Principles

## Constraints
- Check that the proposed action is in the list of available actions
- That you meet all the preconditions for the action, like having the correct items in your inventory
